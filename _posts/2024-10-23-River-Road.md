This blog is to share interesting links I've found in researching my hometown.
This post in particular looks at the first north-south road through Miamisburg
using as lens the original survey done in 1802-1803, before the town was platted.

with an overlay showing the two original surveys from the very early 1800s.

In way of understanding this quicker:
The solid black line shows the Montgomery County border.
Two different surveys covered more than just 
Montgomery County was included in two different surveys,
one of either side of the Miami River.
Survey townships don't coincide exactly with today's administrative townships within the county.
The variously colored jigsaw puzzle pieces 
are the townships as surveyed,
with only those shown as needed to color code the county map.
These are labeled in yellow bordered in black.
Today's Montgomery County administrative/governmental townships are labeled only approximately in solid black,
but their borders aren't shown.
To be clear, there's no certain connection between the survey and administrative townships.

Let's focus here on the yellow area at middle bottom of this map, which is now south of Miamisburg. 

(Notice that these labels have a similar format on either side of the Miami River
but have different formats on the two sides. More on those surveys in

<br/>This page holds an actual, active image, from which the screenshot above, the first image, was cropped.
On this page, clicking on a _township_ pops up a small dialog box.  It has itself several pages.  On its page 2 maybe, click on _Survey Plot_ to bring up a GIS image viewer of scans of that original survey page.
<br/>(Sometimes for me, the image scan doesn't display, even after refresh.  Try link 9 below to go directly to one of the scan pages for 02 05 MRS.  Or try link 8 to search for another township or even another survey.
The point really is that BLM|GLO seems to work even when MCEO is glitchy.)

<br/>This page is essentially where link 5 above takes you after a few clicks starting at that _township_.
<br/>I plan to discuss that survey page in the next post.  Yes, I do.  Adieu!
