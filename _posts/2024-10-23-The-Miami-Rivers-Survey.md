title: the Miami Rivers Survey

The 1802-1803 Miami Rivers Survey (MRS) included where Miamisburg would soon afterward be built,
and especially the land immediately south.

# PLSS Townships
The survey term _township_ here differs from its use as the more usual governmental division.
In terms of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) developing at that time,
a _township_ is typically a square area of land 6 miles on each side, containing 36 square _sections_ 1 mile on each side.

Despite the nearby label "MIAMI TWP", survey _township_ 02 05 MRS does not coincide with the governmental unit Miami Township.

Looking a bit ahead:  notice the odd lack of uniformity in the labeling of townships on the two sides of the river.
Why?:  two surveys with differing methodologies.

# The Miami Rivers Survey (MRS)
The methodology used for the initial Symmes Purchase along the Ohio River arrayed neighboring townships to the east and to the west as being in the same _range_.  This meant that they are in the same row along similar latitude.
This private decision was quickly superseded by developing PLSS standards used in other surveys, especially in the survey of the _Congress Lands West of Miami River_.

That survey arrayed instead neighboring townships to the north and to the south as being in the same _range_ — i.e., using again confusingly the same term _range_.  This meant that they are in the same column along similar longitude. 
But the decision for the Symmes survey was continued northward for the rest of the MRS — the uniformity within that MRS survey taking precedence over uniformity with the developing PLSS standard.

The Miami Rivers Survey (MRS) recorded land between the Great Miami River to the west and the Little Miami River to the east.
It began at the Ohio River to the south.  Two boundaries — the Greenville Treaty Line and the Ludlow Line — form the survey's northeast corner near Bellefontaine. 
(Israel Ludlow was the lead surveyor.)

So MRS is an oddball among surveys and Miamisburg sits along the river separating opposing layouts and terminology.
The **caveat** here is:
don't expect the arrangement and labeling of townships to be uniform on the two sides of the Miami River! 

Check out the links below to explore related material.  MCEO focuses on Montgomery County
and so it's easier to find local material.  But BLM may have additional scan versions and, maybe I think, more dependable uptime.
Their underlying interface is the same, and it can be troublesome — e.g., clicking to zoom can be misinterpreted as beginning a grab-to-reposition — or is it the other way around?  I prefer using the explicit controls to zoom or to move, to full-screen the view, etc.  And some browsers may work better than others.
However that all is, the resources available amply repays the trouble.
