title: southern Montgomery County in the Miami Rivers Survey 
---

In 1802-1803 the area immediately south of where Miamisburg would soon be built was recorded in the Miami Rivers Survey (MRS).

The survey term _township_ here seems largely unrelated to its use as the more usual governmental division.
In terms of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) developing at that time,
a _township_ is typically a 6x6 mile area, containing 36 _sections_ of 1 square-mile each.

Despite the nearby label "MIAMI TWP", survey _township_ 02 05 MRS is not exactly governmental unit Miami Township.

Note the odd lack of uniformity in the labeling of townships on the two sides of the river.
Why?:  two surveys with differing methodologies.

# The Miami Rivers Survey (MRS)

The Miami Rivers Survey (MRS) recorded land between the Great Miami River to the west and the Little Miami River to the east.
It began at the Ohio River to the south.  Two boundaries — the Greenville Treaty Line and the Ludlow Line — form the survey's northeast corner near Bellefontaine. 
(Israel Ludlow was the lead surveyor.)  

The methodology used for the initial Symmes Purchase along the Ohio River arrayed neighboring townships to the east and to the west as being in the same _range_.
This private decision was quickly superseded by developing PLSS standards used in other surveys, especially in the survey of the _Congress Lands West of Miami River_.
In that survey, neighboring townships are arrayed instead to the north and to the south as being in the same _range_ — i.e., using again the same term _range_.  
But the decision for the Symmes survey was continued northward for the rest of the MRS — the uniformity within that survey taking precedence over uniformity
with the developing PLSS standard.

So MRS is an oddball among surveys and Miamisburg sits along the river separating opposing layouts and terminology.
The *caveat* here is:
don't expect the arrangement and labeling of townships to be uniform on the two sides of the Miami River! 

Check out the links below for related material.  MCEO focuses on the area.
BLM may have additional scan versions and, maybe, uptime.
They have similar interfaces, which can be troublesome — e.g., clicking to zoom can be misinterpreted as beginning a grab-to-reposition, so prefer an explicit control to zoom, etc.
And some browsers may work better than others.  However that is, the resources available make the trouble well worthwhile.
