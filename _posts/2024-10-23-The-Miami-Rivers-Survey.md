title: the Miami Rivers Survey

The 1802-1803 Miami Rivers Survey (MRS) included where Miamisburg would soon afterward be built,
and especially the land immediately south.

# PLSS Townships
The survey term _township_ here differs from its use as the more usual governmental division.
In terms of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) being developed at that time,
a _township_ is typically a square area of land 6 miles on each side, containing 36 square _sections_ 1 mile on each side.  _Fractional sections_ accommodate irregular boundaries like rivers.

Despite the nearby label "MIAMI TWP", survey _township_ 02 05 MRS does not coincide with the governmental unit Miami Township.

As we'll see below, the odd lack of uniformity in the labeling of townships on the two sides of the river
stems from two separate surveys with differing methodologies.  This blog is to share interesting links I've found in researching this and that.  This post in particular is to prevent for you the confusion I worked through myself in rationalizing the unexpected survey differences.

# The Miami Rivers Survey (MRS)
The methodology used for the initial Symmes Purchase along the Ohio River arrayed neighboring townships to the east and to the west as being in the same _range_.  This determined that they are in the same "row" along similar latitude and that _range_ means here east/west _row_.
This private decision was quickly superseded by developing PLSS standards used in other surveys, especially in the survey of the _Congress Lands West of Miami River_.

That _Congress Lands West of Miami River_ survey arrayed instead neighboring townships to the north and to the south as being in the same _range_ — i.e., using again confusingly the same term _range_.
This determined that they are in the same "column" along similar longitude
and that _range_ means here instead north/south _column_.
But the decision for the Symmes survey was continued northward for the rest of the MRS — the uniformity within that MRS survey taking precedence over uniformity with the developing PLSS standard.

The Miami Rivers Survey (MRS) recorded land between the Great Miami River to the west and the Little Miami River to the east.
It began at the Ohio River to the south.  Two boundaries — the Greenville Treaty Line and the Ludlow Line — form the survey's northeast corner near Bellefontaine. 
(Israel Ludlow was the lead surveyor.)

So MRS is an oddball among surveys and Miamisburg sits along the river separating opposing layouts and terminology.
The **caveat** here is:
don't expect the arrangement and labeling of townships to be uniform on the two sides of the Miami River!

MCEO focuses on Montgomery County
and so it's easier to find local material.  But BLM may have additional scan versions and, maybe I think, more dependable uptime.
Their underlying interface is the same, and that interface can be troublesome — e.g., clicking to zoom can be misinterpreted as beginning a grab-to-reposition — or is it the other way around?  I began to prefer using the explicit controls to zoom or to move the image, to full-screen the view, etc.  And some browsers may work better than others.
However that all is, the resources made available amply repays the trouble.
